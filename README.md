# Website---Dance-School
I designed and developed a static website using HTML, CSS, and PHP, focusing on clean code and a user-friendly structure. I optimized the site for responsiveness to ensure smooth performance on all devices. 
I used modern design principles to create an engaging and aesthetically pleasing interface.
